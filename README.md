# Digital-Marketing-Analyst-Case-Study
I analyze Facebook traffic data to inform advertisement strategy for a cosmetics brand. 

The dataset is publicly available; please, refer to the my Word write-up with a direct link. In my word write up, I explain my thought process,
my findings of analysis, and my experimental design procedures. 

In particular, I utilized a regression technique as well as statistical tests to understand the "value" of a Share, Like, Comment, if there are better
times to post during the week, if there are better mediums that drive more traffic ie) photo, video, text, etc.

I also presented my key findings of my analysis to the cosmetics brand business owner within the Word file write-up. My findings are valuable because 
it will inform digital advertisement strategy for the brand moving forward.
